WebUI mode runs ThairaAI as a local HTTP server so you can use it from any device on your network — phone, tablet, or another computer.

## Enable WebUI

Go to **Settings → WebUI** and toggle WebUI on. ThairaAI will show:

- A local URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:3000`)
- A QR code you can scan from your phone

## Access methods

| Method          | Use case                                      |
| --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| LAN URL         | Same network (home, office)                   |
| QR code         | Quick mobile access on the same network       |
| Tunnel (ngrok)  | Cross-network access from anywhere            |

## Chat platform bots

You can also reach ThairaAI through messaging apps by configuring a bot token in **Settings → WebUI → Channels**:

- Telegram
- Lark (Feishu)
- DingTalk
- WeChat
- WeCom (Enterprise WeChat)
- WhatsApp
- Slack (coming soon)

<Aside type="note">
  Each channel requires a bot token from that platform. Setup instructions are in the channel configuration dialog inside the app.

## Security

WebUI uses password authentication by default. Set a password in **Settings → WebUI → Password** before exposing it outside your local network.
